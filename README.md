# Project Overview and Reflection

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This is a project created during my time at Southern New Hampshire University. The purpose of this project is to read an external file document and create an ordered set that includes the name of a word from the file 
and the number of times that word appears in the external file. This project was created using C++ as the chosen programming language and uses Object-Oriented programming design. 


### What did you do particularly well?

When I was working through this program I felt my strongest point was when I was designing the user interface and information display. I feel that both of these areas were easy for a user to understand at a glance and they displayed information in a way that anyone 
who would use the program could get the information they needed quickly.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I feel that my code could be made better if I were to implement a better search algorithm. I implemented a linear search algorithm due to the nature of the project but if I were working with a larger dataset it could result in much longer times to display the information.
This code could also benefit from breaking up the multiple item display outputs into smaller screens of information. Currently, all information is output at once and if a user were to use this program they could easily lose track of information they need to record.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging function to write was the function that handles inputs from a file and initializes the set for display purposes. I did have trouble getting the set to initialize at first but I started talking my way through the function and how it should be functioning.
After reading through the code and referencing the c++ documentation I realized I had misplaced some of my functionality and left the set unaccessible to the return statement. 

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The main skill I feel is transferable is creating a project from an Object-Oriented approach. This project has helped me understand better how I can design my code and how I can think about a project's requirements. 

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I documented my code with annotations that display the functionality of each function and separated functions that did not belong in the class to a separate handler file to make it easier to access these functions. I also used industry-standard naming conventions
 for my code to make my variables easier to read.
